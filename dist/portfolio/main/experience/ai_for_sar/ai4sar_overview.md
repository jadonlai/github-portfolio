# 🛠 AI for Search and Rescue - Public Transit Widget

**Project Overview:**  
The AI for Search and Rescue (AI4SaR) Public Transit Widget is designed to assist first responders by providing predictions on possible locations of missing persons based on public transit patterns. Using advanced machine learning models, the widget estimates where a missing person might go within a transit system like the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and provides probabilities for each station.

## 🚀 Project Summary

With no prior work done in this niche field, I am leading the research and development efforts for Cal Poly's AI4SaR team. This widget operates under the principle that a missing person may "follow the crowd" on public transit, and I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of BART's patterns and features to support this assumption.

### Key Goals:

- **Predictive Recommendations:** Identify likely stations where a missing person may be found.
- **Probability Estimates:** Provide first responders with probabilities for each station, aiding in decision-making and response efficiency.

## 🔍 Research & Development

This project breaks new ground by applying AI in public transit to improve search and rescue operations. Key research focuses include:

- **Feature Analysis:** Identifying influential features in transit patterns, such as peak hours and crowd dynamics.
- **BART System Mapping:** Using Folium and Plotly to create interactive maps that visualize patterns and station probabilities for the BART system.

## 📈 Future Goals

The AI4SaR Public Transit Widget is an ongoing project with continuous improvements to both model accuracy and data visualization capabilities. Upcoming development includes incremental model improvements and adding a unique search radius around the predicted station, based on city roads and the average person's walking speed.
