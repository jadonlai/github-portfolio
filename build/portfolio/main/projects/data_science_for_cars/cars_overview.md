# üöó Used Car Data Analysis

**Project Overview:**  
This project analyzed a Kaggle dataset of used cars to provide affordable and relevant recommendations for college students. Using AI clustering techniques, distinct groupings of cars were created to help users quickly identify cars that fit their budget, fuel efficiency needs, and preferred car types.

## üîç Approach and Key Features

- **Clustering Methodology:**

  - The dataset was segmented into three clusters, with each group representing a different category of cars:
    - **Luxury and Exotic Cars:** High-end, unique, or expensive options.
    - **Economical "Beater" Cars:** Affordable, reliable choices for budget-conscious students.
    - **Efficient, Budget-Friendly Cars:** Cars that offer the best fuel efficiency for a lower price.

- **User Guidance:**
  - Based on user input‚Äîsuch as price range, desired MPG, make, and model‚Äîrecommendations are generated from the clusters. This approach offers flexibility for users who may be uncertain about specific car features, allowing them to explore cars within broadly defined categories.

## üìà Results and Analysis

- **Cluster Insights:**

  - Detailed analysis of each cluster revealed intuitive groupings based on observed attributes like price, fuel efficiency, and car type. Although no predefined labels were available, the algorithm provided distinct and meaningful car groupings, helping users make informed choices based on common characteristics.

- **Limitations:**
  - Due to the absence of labeled categories, groupings are based on observed correlations and may reflect trends rather than concrete classifications. This model offers useful recommendations but may require user interpretation.
